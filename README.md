# SDC-SIS
SDC C&amp;DH Systems Interaction Simulator
We will have different “modules”, from each subgroup: batteries, star-trackers, gyroscopes, propulsion, etc.
We will simulate their interactions on other systems/modules. This includes power draw, communication protocols to other systems, and will eventually include implementation and testing of system-specific code (eg attitude control for reaction-wheels).
